Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Momo: Hibiya-ku~n. So he isn’t here, after all.

Marry: momo-chiya

Momo: Ah, Marry-chan.

Marry: hibiya-kun

Momo: Yeah, Hibiya-kun hasn’t returned home after leaving to the woods, and there was a little something I wanted to ask him~

Marry: whh wha

Momo: What I was gonna ask? Well, then, guess I’ll make a request to Marry-chan too~

Marry: ?

Momo: If Hibiya-kun happens to come to the chatroom, I want you to ask him if he leaves the white fiber parts of tangerines behind~. I’m debating something with Onii-chan! Even if just a little, I wanna gather white fiber stubs! Can I count on you?

Marry: ye ah

Momo: I’ll be in your care~

A few days later…

Hibiya: Someone! Isn’t there anybody around!? Help!! I’ve finally realized it! People aren’t supposed to live in forests! It seems my phone’s battery is about to die. I wanna go home! Someone!!!

Marry: mo hi

Hibiya: Someone else!!!

Marry: a aang

Hibiya: I kinda understand that you’re angry at me… Actually, could it be you’re the only one here?! Why is it that no one is ever around in the times I need them?! Even though they always log in for no reason!

Marry: ee everyone hat ham has gone out

Hibiya: I’ve been able to calm down thanks to your horrible typing… Everyone has gone out, huh. What do I do…?

Marry: whath wha what’s wrong

Hibiya: I thought of leaving the forest and have been walking for a while now but, I don’t know why, I can’t get out. On top of it, I’m at a forked path…

Marry: ah hibiya-ku

Hibiya: Hm? What is it? Do you have anything to tell me?

Marry: tan taan

Hibiya: Sound effects?

Marry: tang tank

Hibiya: Are you perhaps telling me to take a turn? Since earlier, no matter how far I went forward, I couldn’t manage to leave the forest. I think whichever way I go at this point will have the same result…

Marry: tan rine tank

Hibiya: I get it. If you say so, I’ll turn right.

A few minutes later…

Hibiya: I got out of the forest! The long time I spent lost in there feels like a lie… But, I don’t know where I am… Where should I go next?

Marry: whitee fi

Hibiya: “White fi”?

Marry: berr

Hibiya: Could it be… Indeed, there’s a geezer sitting on a white fiber chair right in front of me! I hadn’t noticed him at all… Meaning I should ask him for directions, right!? Is it possible… that you knew about all this?

Marry: eh

Hibiya: Showing me road in order to guide me… I owe you my life. You’re a messiah. No, a goddess…!

Marry: li listen

Hibiya: A new indication!?

Marry: lea ave behint

Hibiya: “Behint”… Behind? Ah! There is an antiques store behind the geezer sitting on the white fiber chair! There are eerie dolls lined-up at the storefront!

Marry: bee belind part

Hibiya: That is right. Having an object of worship is an important part of being a believer like me. I will buy one. A doll, that is.

---

A few minutes later…

Hibiya: The bear fur that I was wearing by chance was useful. I’m glad the shopkeeper was a reasonable person. I have been successfully able to buy a doll to serve as object of worship.

Marry: i i ii

Hibiya: I understand even if you do not say it all. Once I arrive home, at dawn, I will attempt to form a new organization for you as a deity!

Marry: wa wai ty

Hibiya: “City”? You mean I am supposed to go to the big city!? Understood. In the city, I will gather comrades that will assemble before you.

Marry: eh n no

Hibiya: Aah, my goddess… I do wish to hear your indications further, but my phone’s battery is nearly gone.

Marry: hibiya-ku

Hibiya: Please do not worry. I will definitely grant you glory…! Praise you, Goddess!

Hibiya-san has logged out.

Marry: a-ah~

A few hours later…

Ene: Another kind of disturbing headline has come up. The world is doomed, huh~
