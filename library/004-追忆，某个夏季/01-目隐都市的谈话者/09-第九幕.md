Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Seto: Oi~ssussu.

Kano: Ah, Seto, good work~. Is your shift over?

Seto: Just ended.

Kano: Buy some pork meat on the way back. Dinner will be ginger grilled pork tonight.

Seto: Got it;

Kano: Counting on you~

Hibiya: My…

Seto: Oh.

Kano: Huh~? Hibiya-kun~! It’s been a while~

Hibiya: Ginger grilled pork, huh… Nice… I’d also wanted to eat something tasty in my last moments…

Seto: Hibiya-kun, what’s wrong?

Kano: What’s this, what’s this~? Could it be you got in a pinch again? A while back, you were locked up and asked for aid in the chatroom, was it?

Hibiya: No, no, as expected, not even I would get in a pinch so often. It’s nothing too terrible.

Seto: Did anything happen?

Hibiya: Yep. I went on a stroll in the woods for a bit, but I fell into a swamp, and only my face and hands are out of it. Help…

Kano: There’s a limit to how terrible things can get!! What’s this!? Why were you walking through the woods!?

Seto: Anyone goes for a walk in the woods.

Kano: No, Seto, that might be just you!

Hibiya: I wasn’t strolling in the woods because I wanted… Stuff happened and my parents confiscated my phone, but I had some business that required me to use the phone no matter what. So I tried taking it out with me in secret, but they caught me. I frantically ran away and, before I noticed, I had gotten to the forest. When I realized it, I was in the swamp…

Seto: I get it. When I run off recklessly, I end up in the woods. It happens, it happens.

Kano: There’s no way it “happens”, is there!? Actually, Hibiya-kun, why did you do something so careless? Did you not get your phone back even after talking it out with your parents?

Hibiya: Well, we had an agreement that they’d return it to me within a month if I at least studied proper and seriously…

Kano: Was your business something so important that it couldn’t wait this long…?

Hibiya: Yeah… The new semester started and I met up with Hiyori at school. And she asked, “Why won’t you reply to my e-mail?”

Kano: Ah~, yes, yes.

Hibiya: Someone like me! Got a mail from Hiyori! I couldn’t handle not being able to confirm this!

Kano: Ah~, hm, I see.

Hibiya: To answer Hiyori’s mail, no matter what… no matter what, I needed my phone…!

Kano: E~rm, well, we understand your reasons. Yup, don’t mind it, don’t mind it.

Hibiya: Aren’t you being kinda random!?

Seto: You two, is it okay for you to be having this kind of talk? The swamp…

Hibiya: Well, I really am in a pinch, please help me. I already can’t breathe from anywhere but my the right side of my nose.

Kano: YOU’RE UP TO THE BREAKING POINT!!! First things first, can’t you move your body somehow to get outta there?

Seto: Wait. Swinging your body around is dangerous. The more strength you apply, the further you’ll gradually get stuck into the swamp.

Hibiya: Eeh!? Then what should I do!? I’m at my limit! I’ve been in this situation for half an hour after all!

Kano: “Half an hour”!? Why didn’t you contact us right away!?

Hibiya: Well, I had a hard time getting my phone outta my underwear…

Kano: Stop making of your underwear the usual place to put your phone in!

Seto: Both of you, easy. Hibiya-kun, take a deep breath. Kano, too, leave your phone for a moment.

Kano: Sorry, I’ve calmed down…

Hibiya: I’ve also tried to take a deep breath with my right nostril…

Seto: Hibiya-kun, are there any sticks nearby? Better be as lengthy as possible.

Hibiya: If it’s tree branches, there’s one beside my face. I have nothing to complain about the length.

Kano: So there was one. That’s kinda convenient.

Seto: It can be that branch.

Kano: What’cha intending to do with it?

Seto: Hold it side by side, push it against the swamp’s surface and get out by dispersing your body weight.

Kano: I see!

Hibiya: ‘Kay, I’ll try it!

Kano: By the way, how come you know something like this, Seto?

Seto: I also got lost in the woods for a bit in the past. I ended up stuck in a swamp, was unable to breathe and had been close to dying. My experience from back them served a purpose, huh?

Kano: Well, hum, it’s the first time I hear about this. You had too great an adventure without me knowing, hadn’t you?

Seto: It wasn’t something worth mentioning.

Kano: No way, you’re so cool…

Hibiya: I did it!! I got outta the swamp!!

Kano: Ooh~! Congratulations!! I’m glad, I’m glad~

Seto: It’s great that you’re unharmed.

Hibiya: But now what do I do…?

Kano: As expected, isn’t it better to go back home?

Seto: Your parents are surely worried.

Hibiya: Even if you say that, I don’t know anymore what the direction of my house was…

Kano: H~m, that’s troublesome…

Seto: Hibiya-kun, can you tell what the direction of the forest was as seen from your home?

Hibiya: Eerm, if I’m certain, it was east-northeast, I guess.

Kano: Eh, aren’t you kinda too knowledgeable? Isn’t this sorta convenient?

Seto: Then you should be able to know the direction from the position of the Sun.

Hibiya: “Direction”?

Kano: Aah, I see! It’s evening now, so the Sun is in the west, right?

Seto: Yes. If the woods were at east as seen from your place, if you go west, as in, towards the direction of the Sun, you’ll definitely get home.

Hibiya: Got it! I’ll try to walk facing the Sun!

Kano: But man, Seto really knows a lot of things…

Seto: I also did this often to return home.

Kano: Aah~, that’s why you’d mostly come back when it was sunny. There was a time you didn’t come home until the next day.

Seto: The time I spent the night in the woods was predictably scary. Even now, I can’t forget the feeling of a bear’s breath against my neck.

Kano: Hm, well, it’s a first for me to be hearing about this too.

Hibiya: Hey. I found something kinda like a weird scratch. The trees are hollowed out.

Seto: Aah, that’s a bear’s doing.

Hibiya: “Bear”!?

Kano: Wai That’s no joke!!

Seto: Forests do have bears. If you’ve spotted the claw marks of a bear, it’s best to walk through the woods while yelling loudly.

Kano: No, no! Bears and the like are dangerous! Hibiya-kun, hurry and run!!

Hibiya: Right, I gotta hurry and run… Uuh… I shouldn’t have come to this place…

Seto: Hibiya-kun, that’s not it.

Hibiya: Eh…?

Kano: Seto…?

Seto: Forests are alive. They will only return to you the same sentiment you feel towards them.

Hibiya: The sentiment I feel… towards the forest?

Seto: It’s because we’re scared of forests that the forests in turn become scared of us and causes us harm.

Kano: What’s with the flow of this talk? Kinda seems like something’s started?

Seto: But we live on through taking away the lives of animals and plants, so forests are our lives themselves. I want you to not forget that.

Hibiya: Master…

Kano: Eh? “Master”?

Hibiya: I’m sorry… I was wrong -ssu.

Kano: Hey, hey, your way of talking just changed, y’know!?

Seto: It’s fine as long as you understand.

Hibiya: I… will stay in the woods for a bit more.

Kano: Eh!?

Seto: Living in the woods is extremely hard.

Hibiya: I’m prepared.

Kano: Eh? Eh? What’re you saying!? Why’re you trying to do something even more reckless!!? Plus, on second thought, if Hibiya-kun used his ability of “Focusing”, wouldn’t he know the way back!?

Seto: Kano, it is how it is.

Kano: Eh, eh, what is?

Hibiya: It seems Master’s words didn’t reach him, huh?

Seto: Too bad.

Kano: Eh? What’s this!? Scary, scary!!

Hibiya: Master! I want to hear more of your stories!

Seto: That’s fine. I also haven’t been to the woods in a while. From this point onward, I wanna talk to you face-to-face. I’m heading there right now. I’ll arrive in the middle of the night.

Kano: Eh, hum…

Hibiya: For you to come all the way here… Thank you very much!

Seto: Tonight, we’ll talk until sunrise.

Seto-san has logged out.

Hibiya-san has logged out.

Kano: No, wait a minute… I’d just… wanted you to buy the pork that we’d use in tonight’s dinner…
