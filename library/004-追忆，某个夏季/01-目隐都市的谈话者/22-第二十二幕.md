Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Kano: Ciao~. Everyone~, is any of you awake at this our~? As expected, are you asleep~?

Momo: Hello~

Kano: Oh! Kisaragi-cha~n! It’s rare for you to be awake at this hour, huh~?

Momo: Well~, about that, I was looking over a video site, and before I realized, it was this late…

Kano: You like that too, right~, Kisaragi-chan? Speaking of which, what videos were those?

Momo: Lately, I’ve simply been watching cake-making and decoration videos. I watch them all the time.

Kano: As always, your hobbies aren’t idol-like, huh~. Well, that’s Kisaragi-chan’s funny side, though!

Momo: That’s kinda embarrassing~ ( ☝ ͡ ° ਊ ͡ °)☝

Kano: Is that how you hide your embarrassment?

Momo: By the way, did you have any business?

Kano: No, it’s not like that. I was killing time, so to say. To tell the truth, I went on a little trip. I tried going home by train, but no matter how much time passed, it just wouldn’t arrive at the nearest station, y’see~

Momo: Could it be… you mistook what train you had to board?

Kano: H~m. It’s not my first time riding it, so I think I got it right. But it’s not getting to the station at all, so I was bored.

Momo: I see~. But are you okay? Can you return to the hideout just fine?

Kano: Yep~. Well, if I need to, I can go home by taxi, so isn’t it all right~?

Momo: You sure are laidback~

Kano: I’d been fiddling with my phone, and before I noticed, the landscape had turned into one that I don’t know. I contradictorily ended up becoming curious about where this would go. We just passed by a tunnel.

Momo: No, isn’t there no tunnel near the hideout? You really did board the wrong train…

Kano: But it hasn’t been that long since I boarded it, and even though I was in our neighborhood, once it left the first station, I found myself in an unfamiliar place~, so it ended up becoming a little fun.

Momo: Is that so? Well, Kano-san, if you’re enjoying yourself, then it’s fine…

Kano: Be my conversation partner for a while. Everyone around me is asleep.

Momo: Okay~! Tomorrow is my day off, after all.

Kano: That’s how it’s gotta be! Hn? Did the train’s speed slow down a little? Looks like it’ll stop.

Momo: Is it at a place you have seen before?

Kano: I got out at the station. My~, it’s a station that I don’t know. Is this station empty? It feels creepy.

Momo: Is that a horror setting? Are there any cute characters or something?

Kano: No, no. There wouldn’t be cute characters in a place like this usually.

Momo: No~, I was wondering if it was a bit like a theme park.

Kano: Well, it does have the feeling of a haunted house. It looked interesting, so I tried getting out here.

Momo: You’re on an adventure, huh… Isn’t it dangerous?

Kano: I’m okay, I’m okay. I’ve never heard of its name, but from what I’ve seen, it’s normal. I’ll just call a proper taxi to go home~

Momo: Then that’s all right… but are there no people around? Like, isn’t there anyone who got out with you?

Kano: About that, I’m the only one who got out. There’s no~body here. Speaking of that, I’m in trouble. Moreso than taxis, there aren’t even normal cars passing by.

Momo: Eh!? Is that all right?

Kano: H~m. It feels like a countryside landscape, I guess. There’s nothing here. Can you see this?

Momo: E~rm. It’s too dark, so I can’t distinguish it very well…

Kano: Well, anyway, there’s nothing here.

Momo: Eh, are you really okay? Are you lost?

Kano: Being told that suddenly made me feel embarrassed. Getting lost at my age is a no-no. There was supposed to be a tunnel where we passed by just now, so I’ll try to walk along the railroad track.

Momo: Please be careful, yeah? So that you won’t be run over.

Kano: As one would expect, I won’t walk on the railway. If a train comes by, I’ll escape with a dash.

Momo: Somehow, just from seeing you say this, I’ve gotten a bit scared. You really are okay, right?

Kano: Ah. Wait a minute. I kinda hear something. Sounds similar to bells. Also ones similar to drums.

Momo: A festival!?

Kano: Hey, why did you reply before I finished? Lol.

Momo: Because, if it’s a festival, won’t it be fun~? Is what I thought.

Kano: The atmosphere isn’t so cheerful. Hm. What do I do? The sounds might have come a little closer.

Momo: Eh? People are getting closer? Ask for help…

Kano: There aren’t people in the area. Just sounds. They’re coming closer little by little. This might be bad.

Momo: Eh, eh, you’re okay for real, right!?

Kano: Hey. Ah. This is bad.

Momo: Kano-san? What happened? Please answer! No way… What do I do? Kano-san!!

Kano: JU~ST KIDDING~~!!!! Did I startle you?

Momo: eh wai wha

Kano: I lied, I lied! It was a joke! I ain’t hearing bell sounds or anything like that, and I’m walking the regular road~

Momo: Geez~~!! Hey!! Please don’t scare me like that!!!

Kano: Sorry, sorry! I was too bored~. There are cars passing by like normal, so I’ll go home soon.

Momo: Man! You’re always pulling off a lot of pranks like that!

Kano: Sorry, sorry. Ah, seems like my phone’s battery will die soon.

Momo: You’ll really be fine, right?

Kano: I just got in the taxi, so I’ll be okay!

Momo: Will you be able to return all right? I can beat Onii-chan awake and make him pick you up nearby, y’know?

Kano: I’m fine, I’m fine, I tell you. It’s dark out.

Momo: Anyway, I’ll contact Danchou-san tomorrow morning.

Kano: Counting on you~

Momo: Ye~s! Be careful!

The next day…

Momo: Danchou-san, is Kano-san in the hideout?

Kido: What? Kano? Right now, he’s lazying about on the sofa.

Momo: Ah, really? I’m glad~. So he was able to come back home safely!

Kido: What’s up? Did something happen?

Momo: Well, well, yesterday night, Kano-san told me some stuff like, “I got out of the train at an unknown station~” and, “I’ll go back by taxi~”, so I’d been thinking, “did he manage to return home okay~?”. But if he’s in the hideout, I’m relieved!

Kido: Kisaragi, what… are you talking about?

Momo: Eh?

Kido: Kano was in the hideout the whole day yesterday.
