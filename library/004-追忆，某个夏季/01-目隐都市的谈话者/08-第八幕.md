Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Shintaro: I’d forgotten about it lately, but the Mekakushi-dan is, in a sense, a group of people with superhuman abilities, right?

Ene: Hey, hey! Please don’t forget our precious identity! Look! Even I am using my admirable ability at the moment!

Shintaro: Your ability is hard to understand. What even are the “Stirring Eyes”, anyway? You just use your ability to infiltrate in the internet, isn’t that it?

Ene: No~, isn’t this power about detaching my soul from my body? In that meantime, I don’t get hungry and I feel light. I can also move freely within the internet. It’s honestly the best.

Shintaro: Heck, I’m jealous…

Ene: Well, if I get giddy and continue with it for too long, my body is on the verge of starvation when I get back.

Shintaro: Scary.

Kano: Oi~ssu, Shintaro-kun and Ene-chan. You’re talking today too, huh~. What kinda conversation is it?

Shintaro: Oh, Kano. Well, I was just a bit curious, but can’t the abilities of you guys also be applied to this chatroom?

Kido: You’re having a rare serious exchange today. How fascinating.

Kano: Oh, it’s Kido~. Oi~ssu!

Shintaro: Oissu~.

Ene: Oissu to yo~u!

Kido: Is this a trend or something? I won’t say it.

Momo: Oissu to y’a~ll!

Ene: Oh~! Imouto-chan, oissu!

Kido: I-Is it really a trend?

Momo: Don’t you seem to be chatting about something interesting? Please count me in!

Shintaro: ‘Ka~y, we’ve already assembled, so each of you, try using your abilities.

Kano: Great, great~. Then, who will go first?

Ene: How about having Danchou-san do the honors for this?

Kano: Ene-chan, nice idea!

(T/N: The “nice idea” bit is originally said in English, but written in katakana.)

Kido: Hey. T-That’s too sudden, ain’t it?

Momo: Isn’t it fine~? Yo! Danchou-san!

Kido: Wait, I haven’t readied my heart yet—

Kano: It’s all right, Kido~. Show us your cool ability~!

Kido: You’re simply annoying.

Kano: ( ☝ ͡ ° ਊ ͡ °)☝

Kido: Well, whatever. Let’s hurry and get this done with.

Shintaro: Kido’s ability is the “Concealing Eyes”, huh… You’re able to hide yourself and the existence of things and people near you. In short, it’s an ability that makes others unable to cognize something.

Ene: Looking forward to how it’ll turn out in the chatroom!

Kido: —————

Shintaro: Dang, me too. Hm?

Kido: Went well, if I do say so myself.

Ene: Uh? Danchou-san, you’re giving off the feeling that you pulled some feat, y’know?

Shintaro: What’s wrong, Kido? C’mon, use your ability.

Kido: No, I just erased the words of one message before, right? How’s this? It’s my ability.

Shintaro: Hey, that’s difficult to tell!

Kido: Say what? Then I’ll do it one more time. _____do_____is. See that?

Shintaro: No, don’t “see that” us. It’s so plain!

Kido: Look closely! I erased some letters of the sentence!

Shintaro: No, I can tell that much! It’s unimpressive!!

Kano: My, my, I can’t stand and watch this.

Shintaro: Kano!!

Kano: Kido’s ability isn’t enough to serve as entertainment. I’ll show you something actually surprising.

Shintaro: Kano has the “Deceiving Eyes”, huh? You can transform your appearance into anything else, right? I’m curious whether it can be applied to words.

Kano: Today is Thursday. How’s that?

Ene: Today is Friday, though…?

Kano: Yep. I changed the “Friday” part into “Thursday”.

Shintaro: It’s hard to tell!! That doesn’t bring out the awesomeness of your ability at all!!

Kano: Hey—Don’t say such cruel things! I even became able to use my ability on stuff I write lately! Look! Look, look!

Shintaro: At what?

Kano: I changed “see” into “look”!!

Shintaro: That’s mediocre!!! Actually, why were you even saying “see, see” in the first place?!!! I don’t get it!!!

Momo: Onii-chan! Leave this to me!

Shintaro: Momo! Your ability is the “Snatching”, which gathers people’s attention, right?! I’ve got expectations on you! Show it!

Momo: Boobs. See? Can’t take your eyes off this, right?

Shintaro: No, for starters, you’re writing that down, y’know!? Girls must not say this in front of other people!!

Ene: Onii-chan is so desperate, huh~

Seto: Oi~ssussu.

Shintaro: Ooh, Seto! Isn’t that a star entrance!?

Seto: I more or less understood the situation by skimming through the log. You’re doing something fun, huh?

Shintaro: Seto, how about you join? Aah, but your ability of “Stealing” reads people’s minds, so you’re not that enthusiastic about it, are you?

Seto: It’s fine from time to time. Lately, I’ve gotten better at using it, so I think I won’t end up reading anything strange.

Ene: In short, you can read people’s feelings through this chatroom, right? It kinda makes my heart race~!

Shintaro: ‘Kay, get on with it now!

Seto: Shintaro-san thought something weird when seeing what Kisaragi-chan wrote earlier.

Momo: Uwah…

Kano: That’s no good, Shintaro-kun.

Kido: Could you not come near us ever again?

Ene: Master, I’m disappointed.

Shintaro: uurRaS SHUT UP, YOU GUYS!! Even if he said it was something weird, you don’t know exactly what it is!! Don’t demean people just from your imaginations!!

Seto: May I say exactly what it was?

Shintaro: By all means, spare me from that…

Ene: Master, you’re utterly unbelievable. You kept complaining about everyone’s abilities, but in the end, you only think about these kinds of things!

Shintaro: W… W-W-W-What about you!? Aren’t you just randomly commenting in-between!?

Ene: That “randomly” is uncalled for! Wasn’t I giving precise follow-ups as Master’s ally!?

Shintaro: You were only booing me, right!? Actually, how are you able to type letters down when you’re in your virtual body?

Ene: Eh~? It’s kinda like “ei”. They come out when I have them in mind.

Shintaro: So it’s random?! In the end, you guys don’t have proper abilit
