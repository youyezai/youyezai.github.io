Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Momo: Hello~

Seto: Hello-ssu.

Momo: Huh?! Seto-san, your reply was quick! Are you on a day off from your part-time job?

Seto: That’s right.

Momo: Then you can take it easy, yeah~? You always seem busy with work, after all.

Seto: Ditto Kisaragi-san. You work as an idol. It’s commendable.

Momo: No, no~. It doesn’t feel much like working. I attend school, and I have proper days off. Seto-san, aren’t you on your part-time job nearly every day? Please take it slow today, okay?

Seto: To tell the truth, I can’t take it slow.

Momo: Eh? Did something happen?

Seto: I’m about to clean up the hideout now.

Momo: Eeh!? Didn’t we all clean it up just a while ago?!

Seto: Yeah, everyone cooperated back then, so it was helpful.

Momo: I was appalled~. It was like those garbage houses that appear on TV.

Seto: It’s something you surprisingly don’t notice when you’re living there.

Momo: Is that really so~?

Seto: But the rainy season is almost here. It’ll be a disaster if we don’t clean up frequently.

Momo: Aah~, I see. If some new species of virus appeared and got you sick, it’d be terrible…

Seto: That’s right… A while ago, we only cleaned up the trash sitting outside, but this time, I’ll be keeping everything tidy and in order.

Momo: Don’t tell me you’re going to do the cleaning alone?

Seto: No, Marry will help too. We were actually all going to do it together, but it seems Kido and Kano had some business to do.

Momo: The hideout is pretty big, so it’ll be a hassle with just two people.

Seto: I thought about waiting for them to come home, but we’re going to clean at least the living room.

Momo: Please do your best! A-And, if you find anything interesting, please tell me!

Seto: I don’t know about interesting stuff, but we did find something nostalgic.

Momo: Eh? What was it?

Seto: A plushie that Kido used to own in the past.

Momo: Plushie…! Danchou-san had a plushie…! How cute…!

Seto: One of these days, Nee-chan brought it here from our house. It’s something she cherished ever since she was small.

Momo: Heeh~!

Seto: It seems Nee-chan didn’t want stuffed toys all that much since long ago, so the instant Mom and Dad found out that Kido liked those, they bought it to her with pleasure.

Momo: I also have dolls that I’ve been given in the past. Their dress-up clothes weren’t very much my type, so I sewed up fabrics together to make some. I’d also arrange their hairstyles. If Danchou-san likes that, I’ll show them to her next time~

Seto: I’m sure she’ll be glad. She normally won’t say that she’d want to see that kind of stuff.

Momo: Even though it’s okay for her to honestly say she likes it~

Seto: Kano is to blame because he teases her.

Marry: unnforgivible

Momo: Ah, Marry-chan. Eh, what’s wrong? What do you mean by “unforgivable”?

Seto: As always, you understand very well what Marry says.

Momo: It’s practice, practice! The rest is that thing called women’s intuition!

Marry: Kano, unforgivible. I’ll get revinge.

Momo: “Revenge”!? What happened, Marry-chan!?

Seto: She was teased by Kano again yesterday.

Momo: Kano-san did that!? Man~! He’s always bullying Marry-chan!

Seto: Kano is the way he is, so I think he was showing affection towards Marry. Though I can’t say decisively that he has no ill intentions.

Momo: Limits exist. Limits!

Marry: revenge

Momo: Yep! Let’s avenge you, Marry-chan!

Seto: No way… Nothing’s born out of revenge, except for more avengers…

Momo: No, she won’t go with the heavy kind, just give him a payback!

Marry: i’ll search for kano’s weak pointt

Momo: “Weak point”, huh~. Seto-san, do you know what Kano-san’s weak point is?

Seto: His weak point? Let’s see… He seems to feel pain when Kido hits him.

Momo: That’s valid for everyone! Speaking of which, even being hit by Danchou-san is because Kano-san does unnecessary things, right? They really do have to pay him back!

Seto: Hu~m… But a weak point…

Momo: This calls for that kind of thing, doesn’t it? Pretending you’re cleaning up, and then secretly getting into his room…

Seto: We can’t just enter someone’s room without permission.

Marry: revenge

Momo: See, see, Marry-chan is also saying it! I’m telling you it’s fine! It’s just rummaging around the shelves a little and sneaking a peek!

Seto: The part about rummaging around the shelves is already out of the line.

Marry: revenge

Seto: Aah, Marry has turned into a revenge demon… She went into Kano’s room in no time.

Momo: Hey, Seto-san, you go after her too!

Seto: Uugh…

Kido: What’s with you guys? Weren’t you cleaning up?

Momo: Ah! Danchou-san! We were looking for Kano-san’s weak point.

Kido: Good. By all means, do as you want.

Seto: You don’t have even the slightest intention of stopping them, huh…

Marry: I foud his seecret nrawer

Momo: “Secret drawer”!?

Seto: It’s a locked drawer.

Momo: Aah, that’s definitely the place where he keeps those kinds of books. He’s the worst.

Kido: Yeah, it’s definitely those kinds of books. Truly filthy.

Seto: S-Stop it, you two! For men, this sort of thing is really inevitable…

Kano: Hey~. Everyone, what’cha doing~?

Momo: Uwah, here’s the Ero-Demon.

Kido: Filthy Ero-Demon. You sure did manage to come out under the sunlight.

Kano: Eh, eh, what!? Hah!? What do you mean by “ero”!?

Seto: They’re talking about what’s inside the drawer in your room, Kano. The locked drawer.

Kano: Haaah!? Eh!? Did you open it!?

Seto: No, we didn’t.

Momo: We can tell that much without opening it. How very dirty of you. I’m disillusioned.

Kido: Never cross the threshold of our house again.

Kano: Wa-Wa-Wait a minute! That’s a misunderstanding!

Momo: Then what’s inside?

Kano: Well, that’s…

Momo: All right, this is a black fla~g.

Kido: Completely black. No room for arguments.

Seto: While we were at it, Marry found the key.

Kano: GYAAAAAA!!!! WHAT’RE YOU DOING?!!!! SETO, IF YOU’RE SEEING THAT, THEN STOP HER!!!!

Seto: Kano… I’m sorry.

Kano: TRAITOR!!! Hey, there’s something really bad there!!

Momo: Marry-chan, open it to your heart’s contentment!

Marry: Ii’ll open.

Kano: He-He-Hey, wai—wait, wait.

Seto: A book out.

Kano: AAAAAAAAA

Kano-san has logged out.

Kido: He fled, huh.

Momo: For him to panic so much… Isn’t it really his weak point? As we thought, isn’t it that kind of book!?

Seto: No, ah—. It’s an album.

Momo: “Album”? Kano-san’s?

Seto: Our family album.

Momo: Wha~t? Isn’t that nothing to be embarrassed of?

Kido: Frankly, he’s not honest at all.

Seto: I don’t think it’s Kido’s place to talk about others in that matter.

Kido: Shut up. I’m also going home now. Since it looks like the cleaning isn’t progressing.

Seto: We’ll be waiting.

Momo: I also gotta clean up after seeing this talk! That’s what I thought. I’m going to tidy up my room for a bit~

Seto: That’s great. Now, then…

Marry: On more.

Seto: Marry.

Marry: I foud one more.

Seto: Marry, stop it already.

Marry: A different book.

Seto: MARRY!! STOP IT ALREADY!!!
