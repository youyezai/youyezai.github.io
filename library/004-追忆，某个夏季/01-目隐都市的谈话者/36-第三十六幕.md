Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Shintaro: Hah~~~~~. I’m bored.

Ene: Nothing to do, huh?

Shintaro: We’re so bored that it’s come to the point that we’re using the chat to talk even though you’re in my computer’s screen.

Ene: This is the last straw. Just how dependant are you? Even though we won’t be able to use the chat from today on.

Shintaro: No, speaking of which, what was that about “the chatroom’s administration will end”? Wasn’t it just a long-term maintenance? You sure startled us.

Ene: But it seems no one knows when will be the next time it’ll be back to functioning, y’know? There are rumors about how it might close down just like this and there might be more modern apps by the time it returns. We might really have to bid farewell today, y’know~?

Shintaro: “Bid farewell”, you say. Won’t we just not be able to use the chat? You’re exaggerating.

Ene: Kaa~~~h! This is why Master will always be Master! If you keep that up, Master, you’ll be Master forever!

Shintaro: I’ll be me…!? Dammit… What does that mean…!?

Ene: Master, you’re really only good at playing along in the chat, huh?

Shintaro: ‘Cause it’s not like we’re talking face-to-face.

Ene: Well, I’m in Master’s computer screen right now, so the faces that Master makes when typing are perfectly visible to me.

Shintaro: Stop, stop. That’s invasion of privacy. Just what kind of embarrassing face did I end up exposing?

Ene: Your normal neutral face.

Shintaro: Kuh… Too peaceful…!

Ene: You’re too desperate to offer a laugh… Please have confidence! Master is the funniest when he’s himself!

Shintaro: Oh? Is that so? Indeed, I do have a side of me that’s like, “If you’re talking about fun, it’s Shintaro-san”.

Ene: By the way, Master, how long are we going to keep up with this meaningless conversation?

Shintaro: Ahn? Hahaah, I see. It’s you we’re talking about. You wanna do something big for the last day that we’re using the chat. This is it in short, right?

Ene: It’s helpful that you catch on quick! Since it’s at great pains our last opportunity, let’s put this chat to effective practical use!!

Shintaro: “Effective practical use”, huuh. Even if you say that, we end up using it naturally, so at this point, there’s no such thing as “practical use”.

Ene: Let’s suggest ideas! We can easily assemble everyone’s opinions into one point! That’s also the forte of group chats!

Kano: I’ve read the situation.

Shintaro: You’re… Kano!

Kano: The man who introduced this chat… Right, I’m the one who truly understands. If I don’t speak of the chat, then who will…?

Ene: As expected of the chatroom’s special corps leader! Your participation rate is enough to make one question whether you’re a permanent resident here! I have my hopes on you!

Kano: Leave it to me. Why don’t we disperse from this chatroom spectacularly?

Shintaro: Hey, don’t raise that flag.

Kano: No matter what anyone says, the charm of the chat is the quickness of the replies! Unlike with e-mails, we can enjoy conversations in real time!

Ene: It’s an iron plater, huh~

Kano: Look! Even if I send, like, 20 separate messages to Kido, who is in the room, the reply will soon—Huh? Ah. Wai—Ouch. Sto—

Kano-san has logged out.

Shintaro: Don’t withdraw the flag so fast…

Ene: It’s an immediate race, so to say; indeed, she was quick to use her hands. Let’s leave him to revive.

Kano-san has logged in.

Kano: To think that the response would come in 3D…

Shintaro: Oh, you were alive?

Kido: It’s because it’s easier to give you one hit than type out every single reply. Honestly, you’re doing ridiculous things again…

Shintaro: That “ridiculous” is upsetting. We’re only talking about helpful things.

Kido: No, for starters, advertising ways to use the chat on its last day available is something overdue at this point.

Ene: A taboo! That’s a taboo, Danchou-san!

Shintaro: We just want to engrave sparkly memories of the chatroom’s last moments!

Ene: Master’s way of putting it is gross, though! In short, that’s how it is! Danchou-san, you share your knowledge too!

Kido: No helping it. I’ve said this countless times, but being able to convey messages to multiple people is convenient. I can easily call anyone who’s free when there are limited sales of whole packs for the price of one egg.

Ene: Your housewife power is hitting the maximum, huh.

Shintaro: Mama…

Kido: Who’s “mama”?

Seto: Sometimes, in the hideout’s chatroom, only things like “eggs”, “cheap”, “free person” and “advertisement” are sent.

Shintaro: Oh~, Seto. Oissussu~

Seto: Oissussu

Kido: Seto, I always end up counting on you for errands. In that sense, you might be the person I talk in the chat with the most.

Shintaro: Well, conversations become fewer when people are living together.

Ene: The chat might be just fine for this, huh.

Kano: Seto, do you have anything for the ways of using the chat?

Seto: Let’s see. I am in touch with the people from my part-time jobs. It’s not like I see them often, so the chat’s convenient.

Kano: Wha…!? Don’t tell me…

Shintaro: That’s a lie, right…? You’re saying you’re enriching your real life…? This is an act of great betrayal!

Seto: We only talk about work, y’know!? Like about the shifts.

Kido: A woman?

Ene: It’s a woman.

Seto: wrsng you’re wrong

Kido: You having fun chatting with a lady that you got to know during a part-time job?

Seto: Misunderstanding. This is a misunderstanding. I’m not doing that.

Kido: So it’s not a woman?

Seto: I-It’s a woman, but that’s—

Marry: Fuun.

Seto: ma ma

Ene: Ah~, ah~, you should have straight-up denied it.

Kido: Marry, don’t you have anything to say?

Marry: Not particularly, no.

Seto: Oh. No. This is—

Kano: Drop it, Seto. Whatever you say now will be hard to witness.

Seto: WE REALLY ONLY TALK ABOUT WORK!!!

Ene: Ah~, yes, yes, we get it. You go thoroughly discuss this case with the Hideout Police later, ‘kay?

Kido: I’m the one in charge of the investigation.

Seto: Uugh…

Marry: Everyone, what are you talking about?

Ene: About putting the chat to effective practical use!

Shintaro: Marry also became good at typing. Anything that made you happy about using the chat?

Marry: Yup. We can talk at night. We can’t make phone calls at night, so it’s a bit convenient.

Momo: OISSU THE~RE ( ☝ ͡ ° ਊ ͡ °)☝ I’m late to join because I was reading the log! Marry-chan, you really became faster at typing~! Girl’s talk at night is so fun that we wind up accidentally staying up late!

Marry: Yup. Chatting is fun.

Shintaro: So that’s why I sometimes hear laughter leaking from Momo’s room…

Momo: Hey! Don’t listen without permission!

Shintaro: You make it audible on your own accord!

Ene: Isn’t it about time, Master, for you to make your room soundproof?

Momo: Right, right! I can’t make phone calls because I get worried about that. But for things like these, in the end, the chat’s convenient! We can have lighthearted talks with people who are far away! Like Hiyori-chan and Hibiya-kun. They somehow feel near, huh~

Shintaro: Ah, you’ve got a point.

Hibiya: Momo contacts us even when she’s got no business, huh.

Momo: Ah! Hibiya-kun!

Hibiya: It’s easier than when we get calls, though.

Momo: Don’t say unfriendly things~! Look! Even now, we seem like we’re so close by.

Hibiya: Hn, well, I actually am close by.

Momo: Eh?

Hibiya: To tell the truth, we used the consecutive holidays to come to the capital.

Shintaro: You’re physically close by.

Ene: Kinda coming in handy, huh? What did you tell your parents so that you could come over this time?

Hibiya: What’s that about telling them anything? I am simply going to take part in a workshop on the research of indigenous people who live in the depths of jungles.

Shintaro: Isn’t your forest life rubbing off on you?

Ene: Uugh… all because I rescued him from that warehouse…! He’s become an unsteady forest character…!

Shintaro: Well, but if you think about it, if your son said that he wants to go study in the big city after having lived for a while in the woods, you’d cry from joy.

Ene: You mean I’d either cry from joy or cry trying to stop him.

Hibiya: They saw me off with goodwill.

Momo: Is Hiyori-chan with you?

Hibiya: Of course!!

Konoha: Me too.

Momo: Ah~, I see, that’s why Hiyori-chan came along!

Hibiya: Can you stop talking lightly of it?

Shintaro: Konoha didn’t participate much in the chat. We did talk sometimes in a separate chatroom, though.

Ene: The two of you get along pretty plainly~, don’t you? When he comes over to the house to play, what do you normally do?

Konoha: We stare absent-mindedly at the rabbit.

Shintaro: We stare at the sky, listen to insect cries…

Ene: Can you stop saying things that give people trouble reacting to?

Shintaro: Whatever we do is up to us! Didn’t we properly go grocery shopping yesterday?

Kido: Aah, shopping for Nee-chan’s birthday stuff. That was a big help.

Ayano: Ah, could it be you’re talking about yesterday? Everyone, really, thank you for coming!

Shintaro: Oh~.

Ene: It’s been since yesterday~.

Ayano: Yup! It was lots of fun~. Everyone’s presents made me happy too.

Ene: Master pro~perly handed his present over, right?

Shintaro: Ah? You guys saw it, didn’t you? Actually, didn’t I give it to her in the same timing as everyone else?

Kido: Well, we don’t know the contents of it, after all.

Kano: We were wondering just what on Earth you’d give her~.

Momo: Ayano-san, what did you get from Onii-chan?

Ayano: About that, it’s a bit difficult to say it myself…

Kano: Hideout Police requested to dispatch.

Kido: I allow the dispatch.

Shintaro: Hey, hey, hey, wait. Eh? Why is this? I gave her a normal present, didn’t I? orotoo

Kano: Hn?

Kido: What’s up all of a sudden? You can’t escape from saying it.

Ene: Wait, Master!! Please look forward. Forward!!

Shintaro: oo ororo

Kido: The suspect seems to be messing around?

Momo: Ene-chan, did something happen?

Ene: Well, this is a slightly nostalgic happening… Master got flustered and knocked over the drink he’d left on his desk… Master’s keyboard is gone again…

Shintaro: rororororo torororororo

Kano: Wa~oh, I’ve heard about this turn of events somewhere.

Ayano: Even though today is exactly the last day we can use the chat…

Ene: Not even mail orders would arrive today, huh. Shall we just go shopping?

Momo: If you’re going to the department store, I wanna go too!

Kano: Oh, seems great~. Guess I’ll go too~.

Ene: Don’t go getting naked in the light-bulbs section and take pictures or something like that.

Kano: I WON’T!!

Hibiya: To be honest, we’re also precisely in the department store.

Hiyori: Hibiya, where are you right now? You should obediently hold the shopping bags and wait.

Hibiya: Sor—just now, I got dragged in the crowd.

Momo: Could it be that Hibiya-kun and the others got separated?

Konoha: Neither Hibiya nor Hiyori are with me.

Kido: You too?

Ene: There, there! Isn’t this a good opportunity?! Let’s use this chat at the very end! We’ll all gather in the department store! Because this chat can be used for meetings!

Momo: Roger tha~t.

Seto: Understood.

Marry: I’m looking forward to hanging out with everyone.

Kido: Since it’s been decided, each of you, commence preparations. We’ll contact one another about the time later.

Ayano: Ye~s.

Konoha: We’ll be waiting.

Ene: Looks like everyone will be coming. That’s great, right, Master?

Shintaro: rororo

Ene: Could you leave a few words at least in the end?! I’ll type in your stead! Everyone! Let’s meet again later~!

Shintaro: Well, then, see you all.
