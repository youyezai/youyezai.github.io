Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Marry: Hello. Marry here. I would like to go out fo r Onanami.

Momo: Eh!? Marry-chan!?

Shintaro: Hey, hey, seriously?! Is this really her!?

Kido: Couldn’t this be… a prank by Kano!?

Kano: Everyone, calm down! This isn’t a dream. That Marry who couldn’t even type a single word on a phone is…!

Marry: Stip. Don’t make fun of me.

Momo: We aren’t!

Kido: We’re just moved by your growth, Marry. To think that Marry would become able even to talk in a chatroom…

Kano: Kido Mama, don’t cry~

Kido: Who is “Mama”? I’ll beat you up. I’m off to beat you up.

Kano: S-Stop, stop! Don’t hit my room’s door! Quit rattling the doorknob!

Momo: But that’s really amazing, Marry-chan! I’m happy that we can talk in the chatroom! ( ☝ ͡ ° ਊ ͡ °)☝

Marry: Mw tpp.

Kano: There’s the fact that it’s a bit hard to understand what you’re saying, but, my, my, this is progress.

Kido: You’re doing good, Marry.

Momo: If you keep up like this, not even a blog debut would be a dream!

Marry: L Ll Le

Shintaro: Hey, y’all, stay still! Marry is trying to write something!

Marry: Let’s all go out for Ohanimi.

Momo: “Ohanimi”…?

Kido: Speaking of which, she was also saying something similar to that earlier.

Kano: If I’m certain, she had said “Onanami” or something?

Kido: “Ohanimi” and “Onanami”, huh… Are those spells? Or maybe codes?

Shintaro: Wait. They might be words passed down by Marry’s family.

Kano: If so, then their meaning…

Shintaro: They might not be words that can be spoken carelessly.

Momo: Man! What are you saying!? If she said “Onanami” and “Ohanimi”, it can’t be anything other than “Ohanami”! Right, Marry-chan?!

Marry: Ye p.

Kano: Aah, flower-viewing, huh~? Isn’t it fine for us to go see them together?

Shintaro: Aren’t cherry blossoms something pretty wide-spread? Instead of going through the trouble of eating lunch boxes outside, it’s the same if we all eat them in the hideout, right?

Momo: Be quiet.

Shintaro: Eh?

Momo: Don’t say anything else.

Shintaro: Hey, Momo.

Momo: Just stop! Get out of the chatroom!

Shintaro-san has logged out.

Momo: Geez, he can’t read the mood. Now, Marry-chan! The weirdo left! With this, we can enjoy the flower-viewing, yeah?!

Marry: Yep.

Kano: Shintaro-kun… (´ ;ω ; ` )

A few days later…

Ene: My, my, it’s sunny, huh~? Everyone, are you heading to the meeting place?

Kido: We’re almost there. In a way, I’ve also made a lunchbox.

Ene: Waah~! That’s great~!

Momo: Ene-chan, it’d be great if you had brought your physical body~

Ene: True~

Kano: Just seeing that in words is scary… Are you guys already there?

Momo: Ah~, sorry, we just entered the park. Onii-chan is waiting in a queue to use the toilet.

Kano: Ah, Shintaro-kun is coming?

Momo: When I was about to leave the house, he acted kinda gross, like, “Oh! You’re off for the flower-viewing? Will you be okay on your own? Hm?” and left me with no choice, so I ended up bringing him.

Ene: I wonder if he’ll at least be of use for guarding our spot~

Kano: Shi-Shintaro-kun… (´ ;ω ; ` )

Kido: By the way, he’s always in the toilet, isn’t he? Shouldn’t he just move into it once and for all? Into the toilet, that is.

Momo: Aah~. He’s in the toilet most of the time at home. It’s already like he lives in there. Quite a bothersome story.

Kano: Now, now. It’s not like Shintaro-kun is in the toilet because he likes it. Hasn’t he come the all way there while wriggling because this crowd got him nervous?

Ene: Just like a Chihuahua coming to get vaccinated, isn’t he? Well, but it’s indeed crowded, huh? The cherry blossoms scattered about a lot, though.

Kido: I also hadn’t predicted this many people. Plus, aren’t their numbers increasing?

Momo: Marry-chan, there’s a lot of people, so will you be okay?

Marry: I’m okey. I’ no

Momo: Eh? What?

Kido: I thought she’d be more anxious, but she’s not alone, so it’s fine. That’s what it seems.

Momo: To think “I” and “no” would have such a meaning…! Marry-chan, you don’t have to push yourself! Let’s talk a lot when we see each other!

Marry: Yep. Thanks.

Ene: Ah~, wait. Sorry for interrupting while you’re in the middle of chatting, but Master has an emergency.

Kano: Eh? What happened?

Momo: Aah… this indeed looks bad. He’d been in the toilet line all this time, but it doesn’t seem to be moving.

Ene: He’s making a cat-like face, as if he’s reaching his limit, and hopping in place.

Kano: Y’know, I have a bad feeling. Couldn’t it be that these people are gathering because of Kisaragi-chan?

Momo: Eh?

Ene: Now that you mentioned it, everyone is looking at Imouto-chan!

Momo: Eeh!? But I had become able to control it lately!

Kido: It’s no wonder that the number of people had been continuously increasing… Anyway, Kisaragi, you back away from the queue!

Momo: But Onii-chan is still…!

Kano: You’ve got no other option but give up, Kisaragi-chan… As long as you stay there, the line won’t move. That won’t help Shintaro-kun’s bladder!

Ene: Ah~, Master! He has started gritting his teeth and saying “sheeshee~”. Please hurry and decide!

Kido: You get it, right, Kisaragi? Leaving that place is for his sake.

Momo: But I…

Ene: It’s fine, Imouto-chan. I will stay.

Momo: Ene-chan…

Ene: See, take a look at Master’s expression. He’s suffering so much that it’s becoming something outrageous, right?

Momo: His face is indeed terrible…

Ene: In order for him to be quickly freed from this hell, leave this to me, and please go to where everyone is!

Momo: Ene-chan… I… I…

Ene: Go, Imouto-chan!

Momo: I… will go to where everyone is…!

Kido: Well said, Kisaragi! You’ve grown up.

Momo: Ehehe…

Kano: On another note, this is really bad, huh? The park is being buried over by the crowd.

Momo: It’s no good for flower-viewing like this…

Ene: Then how about we return to the hideout and eat the lunchboxes there or something? After I see through Master’s outcome, I’ll bring my body and eat too.

Kido: Right. Then, for today, shall we change the plans and throw a lunchbox party at the hideout?

Momo: Yay~! Danchou-san’s lunchbox! I’m looking forward to it!

Marry: I’m looking forwerd to the lunchbo

Momo: Marry-chan, is it okay if we leave the flower-viewing for another time?

Marry: Yep. I had just wanted to play around with everyone.

Momo: Marry-chan… That’s right, if everyone is together, a lunchbox party at the hideout will be fun too!

Marry: Yep.

A few hours later…

Shintaro: Hey, Marry. Right now, I’m watching the scattered cherry blossoms all by myself. Cherry blossoms are beautiful, huh…

Marry: mohi
