Mekakushi-dan Chatroom

Momo: Guys, I’m sorry! I left home late. Looks like I won’t make it in time for the meeting hour.

Kido: What happened, Kisaragi? Some sort of trouble?

Momo: Aah, Danchou-san! The truth is, it was Onii-chan who overslept and wouldn’t come out of the toilet…

Shintaro: My bad.

Momo: Man! At least apologize seriously!

Kido: Shintaro never changes.

Momo: It’s really a pain. I thought about holding it in as I walked, but it’d be terrible if I shit my pants.

Kido: Well, you were probably already having enough trouble with that, so it’s fine. More importantly, you’re an idol, right? What’s that about soiling yourself?

Momo: Ah, sorry, it was on accident. Onii-chan also got angry at me for this a while ago.

Kido: Well, it’s okay to speak however you want. To be honest, it seems we’ll be late too.

Marry: the trin wos lae

Kido: Aah, Marry, no need for you to type. It’ll get confusing.

Momo: The train was late, right?

Kido: Yeah. You’re amazing. You were able to decode that?

Momo: I often talk with Marry-chan on a separate chat! As of now, even if she says nothing but “a” or “u”, I can perfectly understand what she wants to say! By the way, there’s a high possibility that the “a” stands for “Andean Mountains” and the “u” stands for

Kido: I get it. That’s enough. Where are you guys at the moment?

Momo: E~rm, I think we’re not too far from the meeting place… If I’m certain, it was a park with big flower beds, right?

Kido: Yeah, some stuff happened there when we were kids. It’s a place that Nee-san likes.

Shintaro: How unexpected. She’s got interest in flowers?

Kido: No, it’s just that hero shows are held there.

Shintaro: I see, makes sense.

Momo: Ayano-san loves those kinds of things, after all.

Kido: On another note, there are no messages from Nee-san at all. We promised to meet up there, so I wonder if she hasn’t already arrived.

Shintaro: Isn’t she sleeping in or something?

Momo: That’s rude! Onii-chan, she’s not you!

Ayano: I’m here!

Shintaro: Uoh, that was a surprise.

Momo: Ayano-san! I’m sorry, we’re late.

Ayano: It’s okay! Also, good timing!

Momo: What do you mean?

Ayano: Hum, can I change our meeting place?!

Momo: Eh?

Kido: But Nee-san, you’d wanted to go to the park.

Ayano: We can go to the park anytime. Right now, there’s a place I want everyone to come to!

Kido: Well, Nee-san, if you’re fine with this, I don’t mind it.

Momo: We’re okay with it too~.

Ayano: Sorry! I want you to come over here:

Momo: Erm, where is that?

Kido: By the map, it’s not too far from the previous meeting spot, which was the park.

Momo: Ah, then we can get there soon!

Shintaro: Isn’t that a waste factory? Why should we go to such a place?

Ayano: Momo-chan, you’ve said before that you like haunted houses, right? And that you wanted to visit one.

Momo: I did! If I’m not wrong, I pointed that out in some magazine… Eh, did you read it!?

Ayano: Of course!

Momo: Wah~! I’m so happy! I get to try it out with friends!

Kido: Wweiy Wai Hey, I didn’t hear about trying anything out.

Momo: Ah~, Danchou-san, you’re no good with haunted places, huh?

Kido: It’s not like I’m bad at dealing with them or anythi… I’m not bad at dealing with them.

Momo: Great!! Then let’s go!!

Shintaro: Wait a minute. Shintaro-san also hasn’t heard about this.

Momo: By the feeling I got when seeing the map, the road is pretty complicated in this area, isn’t it?

Shintaro: Hey.

Momo: Ayano-san, is there any sort of landmark?

Ayano: Erm, there’s a red sign nearby, so it’ll be okay if you watch out for it when you come over!

Kido: “Red sign”… this kinda gives me a bad feeling.

Momo: It’s okay, Danchou-san! There’s no way Ayano-san would lead us to a place that’s actually dangerous! So please make sure to go. ( ☝ ͡ ° ਊ ͡ °)☝

A few hours later…

Ayano: Quite some time has passed. You guys okay?

Momo: Sorry, Ayano-san… I think we’ll take a bit more.

Ayano: Did you find the landmarking red sign?

Momo: Well, about that… I found a red sign, but Onii-chan kept saying “that’s orange”.

Shintaro: It was orange.

Momo: The next sign we found looked brown to me, but Onii-chan said it was red…

Shintaro: No matter how you look at it, the previous one was red!!

Momo: Onii-chan, you also said that the bean-colored one that we found after that was red!

Ayano: You two, calm down. You’ve come up to nearby, right? If you see a sign like that, look over the area…

Momo: No, we’ll go after properly finding the red sign! It’ll feel losing if we do that! My red is redder than Onii-chan’s!

Shintaro: What’d you say!? My red is redder!

Momo: Anyhow, we’re gonna look for a red that both of us can agree on! Please wait a little more!

Ayano: S-Sure…?

Kido: Sorry, Nee-san. We’ll be late too.

Momo: Danchou-san, did something happen?

Kido: Marry was about to be convinced into buying an expensive vase from a street vendor, so we’re all trying to stop her. We’ll take a bit more.

Ayano: Is that so? Everyone, come as soon as possible…

A few hours later…

Kido: The Sun has already gone down completely, huh?

Momo: We’ve walked around quite a lot, huh… I’m sorry, Ayano-san. I was contemplating the concept of the color red together with Onii-chan, it got this late before we realized…

Kido: We’re sorry too. In the end, she was almost buying not only a vase but also an expensive painting from the street vendor, so we used up our time negotiating.

Momo: Now we can’t tell the landmark apart all that well either.

Shintaro: Ayano, sorry for having left you waiting, but it’s this late, so let’s leave it to another day.

Ayano: But…

Kido: That’s right. Nee-san, let’s go together next time. If you show us the way, we won’t get lost.

Ayano: ‘Kay…

Momo: Ayano-san! Let’s hang out another time!

Ayano: If Momo-chan says so, let’s leave it to another time.

Kido: Looks like my phone’s battery is about to die.

Momo: It seems our phones are also at their limit, so should we call it a day?

Kido: Be careful on your way home.

Momo: All ri~ght, Danchou-san!

Ayano: Sorry~, guys~. It seems I dropped my phone somewhere so I wasn’t able to get in touch at all! But, everyone, did you go to the meeting place? I couldn’t find any of you. I’m back home now. I’m typing from Dad’s computer. Huh? Guys, who were you talking to until now?

Ene: I just found a wicked headline. Is it related to that?
